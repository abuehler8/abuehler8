# Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Andreas Marc Buehler, a game designer and 3D artist from Switzerland. I love using the Unreal Engine for game development and 3D visualization.

Currently I work at ddrobotecÂ® by Dynamic Devices and serve as Visual Asset Artist. I assist their gamified user experience for their data-driven robotic personal trainers. 

At SAE Institute ZÃ¼rich, I worked as a lecturer in the Game Art & 3D Animation Diploma Degree for almost 3 years. I covered the fundamentals of Autodesk Maya and Unreal Engine 4.

I am now working towards founding an indie game company that focuses on retro-made-new style games.
